<h1>The best movies According to Kavitha</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all- time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Nadigaiyar Thilagam</h3>
<p>
    I Love this movie because it has a good and mesmeraising screen play and mainly it is a biography of Ms.Savitri
</p>
<h3>
    Gangubhai
</h3>
<p>Gangubhai is my most favourite movie because it explains about women empowerment and it gives an energy that you can do it  alone and this movie also teaches you to don't trust people</p>
<h3>
    Dhangal
</h3>
<p>This my third favourite bollywood movie which is about women sports and the strugles they face in day to day life</p>
