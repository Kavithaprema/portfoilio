<h1>About Me</h1>
<p > I am a detail-oriented individual who thrives on balancing creativity with organization to enhance productivity and achieve focused work time. With a passion for Java programming, especially in areas involving user inputs and string manipulation, I enjoy tackling challenges like converting numbers to Roman numerals. Outside of work, I love diving into new hobbies, exploring different cuisines, and occasionally experimenting with new breakfast recipes, although I often find myself skipping it. I enjoy mornings that start leisurely and am always looking for ways to incorporate more creative pursuits into my daily routine.
